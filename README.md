### Innovative 

Innovative idea 
- 1. User can upload there resume , update there profile like about ,skills , endorsement , test , video demo interview,Jobs company can updates there requirements .

- 2. Reward system for user no. Of person visit there profile , no. Test the given recommendations based on that we give them premium features like message to unknown , see requirement of jobs,view which individual has viewed my profile and may more mile stone.
  - Premium features will be available after getting a particular amount of coins or paying a particular amount in rupees, coins can be earned using views and tests.
  - Also a premium user can send a message to any other user without following/being followed.
  - Premium features will be unlocked for a particular amount of time after that again some amount of coins will have to be paid   by the user therefore increasing the number of tests taken by the user and hence increasing the usage of our app.

- 3. Jobs/Mentor  section interviewer can upload jobs based on that the user apply like easy LinkedIn features type and after that  selected  candidate can msg them. bot appear which can  ask some query and give some following test like ie - JSON test for flutter dev based on that get offer of further things.

- 4. And then interviewer can join him/her for inbuilt calling and screen sharing features 
And they can give review to that company and the candidate for future  reference and update as star rating in there profile.

- 5. If Somebody Wants mock interview they can come to the server and give mock interview to other dev as well and at the end rate each other interview .
